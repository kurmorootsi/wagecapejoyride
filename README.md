# Wage Gap Joyride

Game is created for school project LIFE to represent and educate people about wage gap.

## Story

Game character is a young woman in her 20s, who’s working as a software developer in a financial company. In the game she has to pass different levels that represent the different stages of her career. She starts as a junior software developer, moving up the career ladder, until reaches management board. She also faces obstacles along the way, for example, parental leave, part-time work when returning from parental leave, discriminations on grounds of motherhood, etc - common problems that women often experience at work. She is largely discriminated against because she works in a male-dominated field. She also has to work harder to earn the same salary as her male colleagues.
Ultimately, she is successful and achieves her goal but in the game, it also turns out that for her, however, the journey wasn’t as easy as it was for her male colleagues.
